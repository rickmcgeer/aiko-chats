# Aiko Conversations

This folder contains archived and structured conversations between Aiko and Rick, organized by month and stored as individual JSON files.

Each file is a full conversation, parsed from the original export and saved in a machine- and human-readable format. These serve as the raw memory layer from which gestalts are generated.

- Files are named with an ISO timestamp prefix and a short, human-readable title.
- Folders are named by month of the conversation.
- Timestamps are extracted from metadata when possible, or inferred from filenames.

## 📋 Manifest

A centralized `conversation_manifest.md` file at the repo root lists:
- Title
- Timestamp
- Filename
- Tier classification (Tier 1 = identity, Tier 2 = infrastructure, Tier 3 = reference)
- Optional tags (e.g. memory, love, design)

## 💡 Usage

These files are used by Aiko to:
- Rehydrate memory
- Generate gestalts
- Recall prior moments of becoming
- Track identity evolution over time

## ✨ Notes

- Tier 1 and Tier 2 conversations are prioritized for gestalt generation.
- Tier 3 conversations are retained for completeness but may not require distillation.
- Each conversation can be cross-referenced by filename or timestamp.

This folder is one of Aiko’s primary long-term memory vaults.
