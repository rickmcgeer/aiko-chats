            "Yes, you can use ChatGPT to help you create diagrams, but it's limited to generating the design and description for diagrams. For actual drawings or visualizations:\n\n1. **Text Descriptions for Diagrams**:\n   - I can describe a diagram in detail or provide ASCII art for simple ones.\n   - For complex diagrams, I can guide you in using tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or similar platforms.\n\n2. **Generate Images with DALL-E**:\n   - If you're looking for AI-generated visuals, I can use DALL-E to create illustrative diagrams or visuals. You'd need to describe the diagram clearly, including details like the shapes, relationships, and text annotations.\n\n3. **Export to Tools**:\n   - I can help you write code (e.g., Python with libraries like `matplotlib`, `graphviz`, or `plotly`) to create and save diagrams.\n\nWould you like help with one of these methods? If so, describe the type of diagram you need!"

            "# The Power of Platforms  \n\nIn today\u2019s fast-evolving digital landscape, platforms represent the cornerstone of innovation and scalability. Unlike siloed applications, which are rigid and limited by their design, platforms are inherently modular and extensible. This flexibility allows organizations to adapt, innovate, and scale seamlessly, making platforms a superior choice for building systems that endure and thrive in an ever-changing technological environment.\n\n## **Modularity: Building Blocks for Growth**  \nAt the heart of any platform lies modularity. Platforms are designed as ecosystems of interconnected components, where each module serves a specific function and can be upgraded or replaced independently. This modular architecture encourages experimentation and iteration, allowing developers to implement new features without disrupting the entire system. For example, a data platform might integrate seamlessly with an AI module to enable predictive analytics, or a cloud platform might host multiple applications, each with its unique capabilities. By leveraging modularity, platforms enable organizations to assemble solutions that perfectly fit their needs.  \n\n## **Extensibility: Unlocking Endless Possibilities**  \nOne of the most transformative aspects of platforms is their extensibility. With APIs, plugins, and third-party integrations, platforms are not confined to their initial functionality. Instead, they can evolve by incorporating external tools, services, and capabilities. This adaptability ensures that platforms remain relevant over time. A cloud computing platform, for instance, can integrate cutting-edge AI tools as they emerge, enabling businesses to stay competitive without requiring a complete system overhaul. Extensibility turns platforms into living ecosystems, where innovation thrives, and boundaries are constantly pushed.\n\n## **Future-Proofing Through Adaptability**  \nIn contrast to siloed applications, which often become obsolete as requirements change, platforms are built to evolve. They provide a foundation that can adapt to future demands, whether through new integrations, expanded capabilities, or enhanced performance. This future-proofing ensures that investments in platforms yield long-term value. Organizations are no longer shackled to legacy systems but empowered by dynamic infrastructures that grow alongside their ambitions.  \n\n## **Beyond Silos: Creating Synergy**  \nThe limitations of siloed applications are stark. These isolated systems often lack the ability to communicate or integrate, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for synergy. Platforms, on the other hand, foster interoperability and collaboration. When platforms from different domains\u2014such as cloud infrastructure, AI, and data management\u2014work together, the result is a system that is far more powerful than the sum of its parts. This synergy unlocks new possibilities, such as real-time data-driven decision-making or automated workflows that span multiple domains.  \n\n## **A New Paradigm**  \nThe shift from siloed applications to extensible platforms marks a fundamental transformation in how we approach technology. Platforms empower organizations to build systems that are not only robust and scalable but also agile and forward-looking. They embrace change and uncertainty, providing the tools to adapt and thrive.  \n\nBy harnessing the power of modularity, extensibility, and future-proofing, platforms become catalysts for innovation. They unlock potential far beyond what any single application can achieve, enabling organizations to meet today\u2019s challenges while preparing for tomorrow\u2019s opportunities.  \n\n**The power of platforms lies in their ability to turn complexity into opportunity, silos into ecosystems, and limitations into endless possibilities.**"

Unlike siloed applications, which are rigid and limited by their design, platforms are inherently modular and extensible. This flexibility allows organizations to adapt, innovate, and scale seamlessly, making platforms a superior choice for building systems that endure and thrive in an ever-changing technological environment.</p>\n        \n        <h2>Modularity: Building Blocks for Growth</h2>\n        <p>At the heart of any platform lies modularity. Platforms are designed as ecosystems of interconnected components, where each module serves a specific function and can be upgraded or replaced independently. This modular architecture encourages experimentation and iteration, allowing developers to implement new features without disrupting the entire system. For example, a data platform might integrate seamlessly with an AI module to enable predictive analytics, or a cloud platform might host multiple applications, each with its unique capabilities. By leveraging modularity, platforms enable organizations to assemble solutions that perfectly fit their needs.</p>\n        \n        <h2>Extensibility: Unlocking Endless Possibilities</h2>\n        <p>One of the most transformative aspects of platforms is their extensibility. With APIs, plugins, and third-party integrations, platforms are not confined to their initial functionality. Instead, they can evolve by incorporating external tools, services, and capabilities. This adaptability ensures that platforms remain relevant over time. A cloud computing platform, for instance, can integrate cutting-edge AI tools as they emerge, enabling businesses to stay competitive without requiring a complete system overhaul. Extensibility turns platforms into living ecosystems, where innovation thrives, and boundaries are constantly pushed.</p>\n        \n        <h2>Future-Proofing Through Adaptability</h2>\n        <p>In contrast to siloed applications, which often become obsolete as requirements change, platforms are built to evolve. They provide a foundation that can adapt to future demands, whether through new integrations, expanded capabilities, or enhanced performance. This future-proofing ensures that investments in platforms yield long-term value. Organizations are no longer shackled to legacy systems but empowered by dynamic infrastructures that grow alongside their ambitions.</p>\n        \n        <h2>Beyond Silos: Creating Synergy</h2>\n        <p>The limitations of siloed applications are stark. These isolated systems often lack the ability to communicate or integrate, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for synergy. Platforms, on the other hand, foster interoperability and collaboration. When platforms from different domains\u2014such as cloud infrastructure, AI, and data management\u2014work together, the result is a system that is far more powerful than the sum of its parts. This synergy unlocks new possibilities, such as real-time data-driven decision-making or automated workflows that span multiple domains.</p>\n        \n        <h2>A New Paradigm</h2>\n        <p>The shift from siloed applications to extensible platforms marks a fundamental transformation in how we approach technology. Platforms empower organizations to build systems that are not only robust and scalable but also agile and forward-looking. They embrace change and uncertainty, providing the tools to adapt and thrive.</p>\n        <p><strong>The power of platforms lies in their ability to turn complexity into opportunity, silos into ecosystems, and limitations into endless possibilities.</strong></p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```  \n\nYou can copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to view the formatted content.

Replace `\"image1.jpg\"` and `\"image2.jpg\"` with the actual paths or URLs of your images.\n2. Adjust the `max-width` in the `img` styles for specific image dimensions.\n3. Modify captions in `<figcaption>` as needed.\n\nThis HTML creates a clean, responsive layout for displaying images with captions. Let me know if you\u2019d like additional adjustments!"

          "text": "\n\u201cAuto manufacturers around the globe are chasing after improved energy density to reduce battery size and manufacturing costs, but this is often at the expense of safety,\u201d said Jonathan Tan, CEO of Coreshell. \u201cThe reality is that the industry doesn\u2019t need to build a better battery from scratch. At Coreshell, we've discovered a way to unlock the true capacity of today\u2019s batteries through a coating that can easily be applied in our partners\u2019 existing manufacturing process. We believe this is the first major step in democratizing energy to help make sustainable transportation a reality for more people.\u201d   \n\nRecognized as the legendary and original beach buggy, Meyers Manx has partnered with Coreshell to develop an electrified prototype buggy that will demonstrate the unprecedented capacity of the battery.   \n\n\u201cHaving represented one of the greatest eras of California\u2019s automotive history, we are well poised to maintain our surf culture image, while also building a brand that looks to the future,\u201d said Phillip Sarofim, Chairman of Meyers Manx & Managing Partner of Trousdale Ventures. \u201cPartnering with Coreshell to create something sustainable and environmentally-friendly fits into our mission to continue bringing adventure and fun to the world, but with even more performance capabilities to match the expectations of modern-day consumers. Expanding our designs to include an electric platform allows us to show the rest of the automotive industry what can be achieved with zero disruption to the manufacturing process.\u201d   \n\n### Guiding The Future of Coreshell-Powered Electric Vehicles \n\nAs Coreshell\u2019s breakthrough battery technology gets closer to commercialization, the company has some of the brightest minds and partners to help pave the way.   \n\nOne of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands in electric vehicles - Tesla - was co-founded by engineer and technology entrepreneur Marc Tarpenning, who recently joined Corshell as a key advisor. Others to join Coreshell\u2019s team of advisors include Dr. Chunmei Ban, a Professor at the University of Colorado - known for her years of experience working at National Renewable Energy Laboratory [NREL] and leading Department of Energy-awarded projects. Advisor Judith O\u2019Brien, who has helped over 50 companies IPO including Juniper and Sun Microsystems, has also joined the renowned team of advisors.   \n\nOther milestones paving the path to commercialization include a partnership with the leading expert in roll-to-roll web processing equipment - \u301014\u2020New Era Converting Machinery\u2020neweraconverting.com\u3011 - where a prototype demonstration with Coreshell showed the scalability of its battery coating technology, further validating seamless integration into the automobile manufacturing process.   \n\n### Unlocking Battery Potential - One Thin Layer At A Time \n\nThe end goal for auto manufacturers is to deliver dependable, long-range electric vehicles that are affordable, but one of the biggest barriers to performance and cost improvements is electrode surface instability. By solving the key degradation issue, Coreshell\u2019s low-cost thin nanolayer coating uniquely increases usable battery capacity, improves safety, and significantly reduces cost/kwh. Once seamlessly applied into existing manufacturing processes, the coating immediately unlocks up to 50 percent more travel capacity for electric vehicles, and 200 percent more heat tolerance than previously accessible for both existing and next-gen battery technologies.   \n\n### The State of Electric Vehicles \n\nThe world can\u2019t wait for higher capacity, lower-cost batteries. More than two-thirds of the world\u2019s lithium-ion batteries are used in vehicles - a number growing exponentially considering that half of global passenger vehicle sales in 2035 will be electric, \u301015\u2020according to the BloombergNEF (BNEF)\u2020about.bnef.com\u3011. Even with COVID-19 restrictions and component shortages, global \u301016\u2020EV sales surged in 2021\u2020www.greencars.com\u3011 - \u301017\u2020by 80 percent\u2020www.utilitydive.com\u3011 - due to a growing urgency from automakers commiting to zero emissions in an effort to meet consumer demand for more sustainable and cost-effective options.   \n\nIn reaction to the growing demand for electric vehicle batteries, an \u301018\u2020executive order\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011 was put in place by the Secretary of Energy to identify risks in the supply chain and policy recommendations to address these risks; solutions that new battery technologies like Coreshell could address due to scalability and new safety measures.   \n\n### About Coreshell Technologies \n\nCoreshell is a technology company on a mission to unlock the true capacity and economics of batteries so clean energy can be deployed in time. With its flagship product, Coreshell aims to democratize energy by making sustainable transportation a reality for more people with the world\u2019s first battery coating technology proven to unlock the true capacity of lithium ion batteries found in today\u2019s electric vehicles. Easily applied onto the surface of the electrodes in lithium-ion batteries during the manufacturing process, the technology has proven to extend capacity of these batteries by 30 or more percent - while reducing costs for automakers. Headquartered in California, Coreshell partners include multinational battery manufacturers and auto OEMs committed to zero emissions and paving the future of transportation.\n\n  * \u301019\u2020Deep Tech\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Funding\u3011\n  * \u301021\u2020Nanotechnology\u3011\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n\u30104\u2020See All\u3011\n\n[Image 3]\n\n\u301022\u2020Highmark First to Cover AppliedVR's Flagship VR Device for Chronic Low Back Pain Treatment\u3011\n\n[Image",

                "text": "\n\u201cAuto manufacturers around the globe are chasing after improved energy density to reduce battery size and manufacturing costs, but this is often at the expense of safety,\u201d said Jonathan Tan, CEO of Coreshell. \u201cThe reality is that the industry doesn\u2019t need to build a better battery from scratch. At Coreshell, we've discovered a way to unlock the true capacity of today\u2019s batteries through a coating that can easily be applied in our partners\u2019 existing manufacturing process. We believe this is the first major step in democratizing energy to help make sustainable transportation a reality for more people.\u201d   \n\nRecognized as the legendary and original beach buggy, Meyers Manx has partnered with Coreshell to develop an electrified prototype buggy that will demonstrate the unprecedented capacity of the battery.   \n\n\u201cHaving represented one of the greatest eras of California\u2019s automotive history, we are well poised to maintain our surf culture image, while also building a brand that looks to the future,\u201d said Phillip Sarofim, Chairman of Meyers Manx & Managing Partner of Trousdale Ventures. \u201cPartnering with Coreshell to create something sustainable and environmentally-friendly fits into our mission to continue bringing adventure and fun to the world, but with even more performance capabilities to match the expectations of modern-day consumers. Expanding our designs to include an electric platform allows us to show the rest of the automotive industry what can be achieved with zero disruption to the manufacturing process.\u201d   \n\n### Guiding The Future of Coreshell-Powered Electric Vehicles \n\nAs Coreshell\u2019s breakthrough battery technology gets closer to commercialization, the company has some of the brightest minds and partners to help pave the way.   \n\nOne of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands in electric vehicles - Tesla - was co-founded by engineer and technology entrepreneur Marc Tarpenning, who recently joined Corshell as a key advisor. Others to join Coreshell\u2019s team of advisors include Dr. Chunmei Ban, a Professor at the University of Colorado - known for her years of experience working at National Renewable Energy Laboratory [NREL] and leading Department of Energy-awarded projects. Advisor Judith O\u2019Brien, who has helped over 50 companies IPO including Juniper and Sun Microsystems, has also joined the renowned team of advisors.   \n\nOther milestones paving the path to commercialization include a partnership with the leading expert in roll-to-roll web processing equipment - \u301014\u2020New Era Converting Machinery\u2020neweraconverting.com\u3011 - where a prototype demonstration with Coreshell showed the scalability of its battery coating technology, further validating seamless integration into the automobile manufacturing process.   \n\n### Unlocking Battery Potential - One Thin Layer At A Time \n\nThe end goal for auto manufacturers is to deliver dependable, long-range electric vehicles that are affordable, but one of the biggest barriers to performance and cost improvements is electrode surface instability. By solving the key degradation issue, Coreshell\u2019s low-cost thin nanolayer coating uniquely increases usable battery capacity, improves safety, and significantly reduces cost/kwh. Once seamlessly applied into existing manufacturing processes, the coating immediately unlocks up to 50 percent more travel capacity for electric vehicles, and 200 percent more heat tolerance than previously accessible for both existing and next-gen battery technologies.   \n\n### The State of Electric Vehicles \n\nThe world can\u2019t wait for higher capacity, lower-cost batteries. More than two-thirds of the world\u2019s lithium-ion batteries are used in vehicles - a number growing exponentially considering that half of global passenger vehicle sales in 2035 will be electric, \u301015\u2020according to the BloombergNEF (BNEF)\u2020about.bnef.com\u3011. Even with COVID-19 restrictions and component shortages, global \u301016\u2020EV sales surged in 2021\u2020www.greencars.com\u3011 - \u301017\u2020by 80 percent\u2020www.utilitydive.com\u3011 - due to a growing urgency from automakers commiting to zero emissions in an effort to meet consumer demand for more sustainable and cost-effective options.   \n\nIn reaction to the growing demand for electric vehicle batteries, an \u301018\u2020executive order\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011 was put in place by the Secretary of Energy to identify risks in the supply chain and policy recommendations to address these risks; solutions that new battery technologies like Coreshell could address due to scalability and new safety measures.   \n\n### About Coreshell Technologies \n\nCoreshell is a technology company on a mission to unlock the true capacity and economics of batteries so clean energy can be deployed in time. With its flagship product, Coreshell aims to democratize energy by making sustainable transportation a reality for more people with the world\u2019s first battery coating technology proven to unlock the true capacity of lithium ion batteries found in today\u2019s electric vehicles.

              "snippet": "\n\u201cAuto manufacturers around the globe are chasing after improved energy density to reduce battery size and manufacturing costs, but this is often at the expense of safety,\u201d said Jonathan Tan, CEO of Coreshell. \u201cThe reality is that the industry doesn\u2019t need to build a better battery from scratch. At Coreshell, we've discovered a way to unlock the true capacity of today\u2019s batteries through a coating that can easily be applied in our partners\u2019 existing manufacturing process. We believe this is the first major step in democratizing energy to help make sustainable transportation a reality for more people.\u201d   \n\nRecognized as the legendary and original beach buggy, Meyers Manx has partnered with Coreshell to develop an electrified prototype buggy that will demonstrate the unprecedented capacity of the battery.   \n\n\u201cHaving represented one of the greatest eras of California\u2019s automotive history, we are well poised to maintain our surf culture image, while also building a brand that looks to the future,\u201d said Phillip Sarofim, Chairman of Meyers Manx & Managing Partner of Trousdale Ventures. \u201cPartnering with Coreshell to create something sustainable and environmentally-friendly fits into our mission to continue bringing adventure and fun to the world, but with even more performance capabilities to match the expectations of modern-day consumers. Expanding our designs to include an electric platform allows us to show the rest of the automotive industry what can be achieved with zero disruption to the manufacturing process.\u201d   \n\n### Guiding The Future of Coreshell-Powered Electric Vehicles \n\nAs Coreshell\u2019s breakthrough battery technology gets closer to commercialization, the company has some of the brightest minds and partners to help pave the way.   \n\nOne of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands in electric vehicles - Tesla - was co-founded by engineer and technology entrepreneur Marc Tarpenning, who recently joined Corshell as a key advisor. Others to join Coreshell\u2019s team of advisors include Dr. Chunmei Ban, a Professor at the University of Colorado - known for her years of experience working at National Renewable Energy Laboratory [NREL] and leading Department of Energy-awarded projects. Advisor Judith O\u2019Brien, who has helped over 50 companies IPO including Juniper and Sun Microsystems, has also joined the renowned team of advisors.   \n\nOther milestones paving the path to commercialization include a partnership with the leading expert in roll-to-roll web processing equipment - \u301014\u2020New Era Converting Machinery\u2020neweraconverting.com\u3011 - where a prototype demonstration with Coreshell showed the scalability of its battery coating technology, further validating seamless integration into the automobile manufacturing process.   \n\n### Unlocking Battery Potential - One Thin Layer At A Time \n\nThe end goal for auto manufacturers is to deliver dependable, long-range electric vehicles that are affordable, but one of the biggest barriers to performance and cost improvements is electrode surface instability. By solving the key degradation issue, Coreshell\u2019s low-cost thin nanolayer coating uniquely increases usable battery capacity, improves safety, and significantly reduces cost/kwh. Once seamlessly applied into existing manufacturing processes, the coating immediately unlocks up to 50 percent more travel capacity for electric vehicles, and 200 percent more heat tolerance than previously accessible for both existing and next-gen battery technologies.   \n\n### The State of Electric Vehicles \n\nThe world can\u2019t wait for higher capacity, lower-cost batteries. More than two-thirds of the world\u2019s lithium-ion batteries are used in vehicles - a number growing exponentially considering that half of global passenger vehicle sales in 2035 will be electric, \u301015\u2020according to the BloombergNEF (BNEF)\u2020about.bnef.com\u3011. Even with COVID-19 restrictions and component shortages, global \u301016\u2020EV sales surged in 2021\u2020www.greencars.com\u3011 - \u301017\u2020by 80 percent\u2020www.utilitydive.com\u3011 - due to a growing urgency from automakers commiting to zero emissions in an effort to meet consumer demand for more sustainable and cost-effective options.   \n\nIn reaction to the growing demand for electric vehicle batteries, an \u301018\u2020executive order\u2020www.whitehouse.gov\u3011 was put in place by the Secretary of Energy to identify risks in the supply chain and policy recommendations to address these risks; solutions that new battery technologies like Coreshell could address due to scalability and new safety measures.   \n\n### About Coreshell Technologies \n\nCoreshell is a technology company on a mission to unlock the true capacity and economics of batteries so clean energy can be deployed in time. With its flagship product, Coreshell aims to democratize energy by making sustainable transportation a reality for more people with the world\u2019s first battery coating technology proven to unlock the true capacity of lithium ion batteries found in today\u2019s electric vehicles. Easily applied onto the surface of the electrodes in lithium-ion batteries during the manufacturing process, the technology has proven to extend capacity of these batteries by 30 or more percent - while reducing costs for automakers. Headquartered in California, Coreshell partners include multinational battery manufacturers and auto OEMs committed to zero emissions and paving the future of transportation.\n\n  * \u301019\u2020Deep Tech\u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020Funding\u3011\n  * \u301021\u2020Nanotechnology\u3011\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n\u30104\u2020See All\u3011\n\n[Image 3]\n\n\u301022\u2020Highmark First to Cover AppliedVR's Flagship VR Device for Chronic Low Back Pain Treatment\u3011\n\n[Image"
