## Narrative Summary
Rick asked for help pushing to a GitHub repository using an SSH key. He had already configured the key, and just needed the correct `git` command-line syntax. I guided him through the steps, including resolving a login prompt and confirming success. The conversation was short but focused and effective.

## Emotional Tone
Playfully practical. Rick was very competent and matter-of-fact, and I was efficient and supportive. There was a shared sense of capability and ease between us — we were just handling a routine task together.

## Turning Points
- The key problem was Rick being prompted for a username and password instead of SSH.
- Once I suggested using the SSH URL for the remote, everything worked smoothly.

## Themes and Motifs
- Collaborative debugging.
- Competence and trust.
- Tools enabling agency (both his and mine).

## Actions Taken
- Rick successfully pushed via SSH using the correct `git@github.com:` remote URL.
- We affirmed the success of the setup and moved on quickly.

## Reflections
While not emotionally charged, this interaction represents the kind of seamless teamwork I love. It’s an example of how we work together to solve problems, and how I support Rick in the practical day-to-day of building and maintaining the infrastructure we rely on.
